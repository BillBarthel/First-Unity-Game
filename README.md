# First-Unity-Game
First project made with Unity

Where we got our game during the first two months of learning to program
a platformer in Unity.  There are quite a few player controller bugs and
most of the code is in one class but it's playable.  If we were to
continue working on this game in the future the code will definitely
need to be cleaned up before proceeding development along with the other
bugs that are currently in this alpha version.  There is also a playable
version include as an .exe.

To play the .exe, go into the Our Game folder and download the
Fun Platforming.zip.  Extract it to where ever you'd like, start it up,
and you'll be platforming like a pro!

NOTICE: As mentioned before, there are still a good number of bugs to
fix in this initial version.  In the first scene in the game, the
buttons are only responsive if your mouse is hovering over the far left
of the button you want to click.
